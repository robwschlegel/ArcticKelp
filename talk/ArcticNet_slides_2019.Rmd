# What is known?

- Little is known of kelp in the Arctic

```{r, echo=F, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/kelp_question.png", dpi = 200)
```

---
# What is known?

- Trading in Alaria along Baffin Island coast

```{r, echo=F, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/alaria_trading.png", dpi = 300)
```

---
# What is known?

- Other examples?

---
# What is known?

- There should be other Laminariales sp.

```{r, echo=F, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/where_kelp.png", dpi = 300)
```

---
# Where are kelp in the Arctic and what drives their distribution?

- There must be kelp in the Arctic
- We don't know what the drivers of their distributions are
- The Arctic is changing quickly so we should figure this out ASAP

---
# ArcticKelp project

- Several different campaigns

```{r, echo=F, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/where_kelp.png", dpi = 300)
```

- Increasing ground truth obs

```{r, echo=F, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/alaria_trading.png", dpi = 300)
```

- Many sites visited

# Environmental conditions

## NAPA model - abiotic

## Bio-Oracle - biotic

# Modelling distribution

## RF steps
    
Which variables are important

# Results

Show general kelp cover
Drop Alaria if necessary

## Map

## Coastal stretch

## Error around predictions
Where in the errors are the distribution
