# What is known of Arctic kelps? {.tabset}

## Known

- Little is known of kelp in the Arctic

```{r, echo=F, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/kelp_question.png")
```

***

## Past

- Trading in Alaria along Baffin Island coast

```{r, echo=F, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/alaria_trading.png")
```

***

## Present

- There should be other Laminariales sp.

```{r, echo=F, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/where_kelp.png")
```

***

## Other

- RWS: Other examples?

***

# Where are kelp in the Arctic and what drives their distribution?

- There must be kelp in the Arctic
- We don't know what the drivers of their distributions are
- The Arctic is changing quickly so we should figure this out ASAP

***

# ArcticKelp project {.tabset}

## Campaigns

<!-- - Several different campaigns -->

```{r, echo=F, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/study_site_campaign.png")
```

***

## Obs

<!-- - Increasing ground truth obs -->
<!-- - Many sites visited -->

```{r, echo=F, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/study_site_labels.png")
```

## Mean cover

# Environmental conditions {.tabset}

## Abiotic data

- NAPA (3-Oceans) model
  - Model outputs supplied by the Bedford Institute of Oceanography (BIO) ![](figure/BIO_logo.jpg)
  - Based on the NEMO community ocean model ![](figure/NEMO_logo.png)
- Daily surface resolution
- Five day (pentad) resolution at 75 depth layers
- Tri-polar grid
  - 10 to 20 km resolution

## Biotic data

- Bio-ORACLE
  - RWS: Still need to flesh this out
@Tyberghein2012
@Assis2018b

***

# Modelling distribution {.tabset}

## Random Forest

- Which variables are important?
- What is the accuracy of the model?
- What is the range in accuracy?
- What is the distribution of inaccuracy?

***

# Results

Show general kelp cover
Drop Alaria if necessary

## Map

## Coastal stretch

## Error around predictions
Where in the errors are the distribution
