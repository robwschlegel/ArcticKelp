# What is known of Arctic kelps? {.tabset}

## Known

- Little is known of kelp in the Arctic

![](figure/kelp_question.png)

***

## Past

- Trading in Alaria along Baffin Island coast

![](figure/alaria_trading.png)

***

## Present

- There should be other Laminariales sp. ... but where?

![](figure/where_kelp.png)

***

## Other

- RWS: Other examples?

***

# ArcticKelp project {.tabset}

- There must be kelp in the Arctic
- RWS: Bullet about what ArcticKelp seeks toa ccomplish
- We don't know what the drivers of their distributions are
- The Arctic is changing quickly so we should figure this out ASAP
- Where are kelp in the Arctic and what drives their distribution?
- Does this differ for different functional groups?
  - Total kelp cover
  - Laminariales (Laminaria sp. + Sacharina sp.)
  - Agarum
  - Alaria

## Campaigns

<!-- - Several different campaigns -->

![](figure/study_site_campaign.png)

***

## Sites

<!-- - Increasing ground truth obs -->
<!-- - Many sites visited -->

# Environmental conditions {.tabset}

## Abiotic data

- NAPA (3-Oceans) model
  - Model outputs supplied by the Bedford Institute of Oceanography (BIO)  
  ![](figure/BIO_logo.jpg){ width=20% }  
  - Based on the NEMO community ocean model  
  ![](figure/NEMO_logo.png){ width=20% }  
  [@Madec2015]  
  - Ice from the LIM3 model  
  ![](figure/LIM_logo.png){ width=20% }  
  [@Vancoppenolle2009; @Rousset2015]  
  - Daily surface resolution: 1998 to 2015
  - Five day (pentad) resolution at 75 depth layers
  - Tri-polar grid
    - 10 to 20 km resolution

## Biotic data

- Bio-ORACLE
  - 18 total geophysical, biotic and environmental variables
  - Surface and benthic coverage; min, mean, max, and range for most
  - Collection from many different datasets
  - 5 arcdegree spatial resolution (~9.2 km at the equator)

# Modelling distribution {.tabset}

- Which variables are important?
- What is the accuracy of the model?
- What is the range in accuracy?
- What is the distribution of inaccuracy?

## Methods

- Highly correlated variables were removed
- A random forest model was used
- After many iterations the best variables were found
- These were used for many iterations to find the best model

## Variables {.tabset}

### Total kelp

```{r, echo=FALSE}
load("data/top_full_kelpcover.RData")
knitr::kable(x = top_full_kelpcover, format = "html")
```

***

### Laminariales

```{r, echo=FALSE}
load("data/top_full_laminariales.RData")
knitr::kable(x = top_full_laminariales, format = "html")
```

***

### Agarum

```{r, echo=FALSE}
load("data/top_full_agarum.RData")
knitr::kable(x = top_full_agarum, format = "html")
```

***

### Alaria

```{r, echo=FALSE}
load("data/top_full_alaria.RData")
knitr::kable(x = top_full_alaria, format = "html")
```

# Results {.tabset}

- Note that the colour scales are not the same between figures

## Total cover

## Laminariales

***

## Agarum

***

## Alaria

<!-- ## Coastal stretch -->
<!-- The thinking here was to show all of the coastal pixels as a histogram or something like that -->
<!-- Perhaps a histogram of depth <50 would be useful -->
