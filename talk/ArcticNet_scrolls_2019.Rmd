# What is known of Arctic kelps? {.tabset}

## Present

- Evidence suggests that many Arctic coasts should support seaweed
- In Canada, kelp has been reported and documented along Arctic and subarctic coastlines  
- However, baseline measures of the extent of kelp communities are missing in much of the region   

![](figure/kelp_question.png)

***

## Future

-  Rapid environmental changes such as declining sea ice, increased ocean temperatures and freshwater inputs are occurring along these coasts 
- Research suggests northern expansion of kelp forests with climate change
- Therefore the relationships between environmental factors and the presence of kelp forests in the Canadian arctic are critical to understand

# ArcticKelp project {.tabset}

<!-- SIMEP 2019: Saw that there is not as much soft-surface sediment as thought. Kelp forests there are as impressive as Ecklonia maxima. -->
<!-- PICKeR: Eclipse Sound 2019 was mostly Agarum dominated. -->
<!-- The amount of kelp cover in the Arctic is exceptionally higher than expected. -->
<!-- The Arctic is currently thought to be very nuttient deprived. How will the eroding of Arctic coastlinesa affect this? -->

- Where are kelp in the Arctic and what drives their distribution?
- The Arctic is changing quickly so we should figure this out ASAP
- Kelp abundance records (percent cover by species) were obtained from ArcticKelp project
- This dive research conducted throughout the Canadian Arctic in 2014 - 2019 
    - 5 - 20 m photograph quadrats
<!-- - These _in situ_ collected data will help us to know what the drivers kelp distributions are -->
- Do these drivers differ for different functional groups?
  - Total kelp cover
  - Laminariales (Laminaria sp. + Sacharina sp.)
  - Agarum
  - Alaria

## Campaigns

<!-- - Several different campaigns -->

<!-- ## Sites -->

<!-- - Increasing ground truth obs -->
<!-- - Many sites visited -->

# Environmental conditions {.tabset}

## Abiotic data

- NAPA (3-Oceans) model
  - Model outputs supplied by the Bedford Institute of Oceanography (BIO)  
  ![](figure/BIO_logo.jpg){ width=20% }  
  - Based on the NEMO community ocean model

  [@Madec2015]  
  - Ice from the LIM3 model  
  ![](figure/LIM_logo.png){ width=20% }  
  [@Vancoppenolle2009; @Rousset2015]  
  - Daily surface resolution: 1998 to 2015
  - Five day (pentad) resolution at 75 depth layers
  - Tri-polar grid
    - 10 to 20 km resolution

## Biotic data

- Bio-ORACLE
  - 18 total geophysical, biotic, and environmental variables
  - Collection from many different datasets
  - Surface and benthic coverage
  - Data from 2000 - 2014 for most
  - Single values per pixel; min, mean, max, and range for most
  - 5 arcdegree spatial resolution (~9.2 km at the equator)

# Modelling distribution {.tabset}

- Using existing models, can we predict the % coverage of kelp?
- Which variables are important?
- What is the accuracy of the model?
- What is the range in accuracy?
- What is the distribution of inaccuracy?

## Methods

- Highly correlated variables were removed
- A random forest model was used
- After many iterations the best variables were found
- These best variables were used over many iterations again to find the best models

## Variables {.tabset}

<!-- Show top five and bottom five. Show the average Inc MSE/1000 -->

### Total kelp

```{r, echo=FALSE}
load("data/top_full_kelpcover.RData")

```{r, echo=FALSE}
load("data/top_full_laminariales.RData")
knitr::kable(x = top_full_laminariales, format = "html")

### Agarum

```{r, echo=FALSE}
load("data/top_full_agarum.RData")

<!-- ## Coastal stretch -->
<!-- The thinking here was to show all of the coastal pixels as a histogram or something like that -->
<!-- Perhaps a histogram of depth <50 would be useful -->

# Further work

- Better screening of variables used in model
- Increase resolution of data
