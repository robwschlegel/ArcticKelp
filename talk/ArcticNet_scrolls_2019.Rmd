# What is known of Arctic kelps? {.tabset}

## Known

- Little is known of kelp in the Arctic

![](figure/kelp_question.png)

***

## Past

- Trading in Alaria along Baffin Island coast

![](figure/alaria_trading.png)

***

## Present

- There should be other Laminariales sp.

![](figure/where_kelp.png)

***

## Other

- RWS: Other examples?

***

# ArcticKelp project {.tabset}

- There must be kelp in the Arctic
- We don't know what the drivers of their distributions are
- The Arctic is changing quickly so we should figure this out ASAP
-  Where are kelp in the Arctic and what drives their distribution?

## Campaigns

<!-- - Several different campaigns -->

![](figure/study_site_campaign.png)

***

## Sites

<!-- - Increasing ground truth obs -->
<!-- - Many sites visited -->

## Mean cover

# Environmental conditions {.tabset}

## Abiotic data

- NAPA (3-Oceans) model
  - Model outputs supplied by the Bedford Institute of Oceanography (BIO) 
  ![](figure/BIO_logo.jpg){ width=20% }
  - Based on the NEMO community ocean model 
  ![](figure/NEMO_logo.png){ width=20% }
  - Daily surface resolution; 1998 to 2015
  - Five day (pentad) resolution at 75 depth layers
  - Tri-polar grid
    - 10 to 20 km resolution
![](figure/NAPA_resolution_graph.png){ width=40% }

***

## Biotic data

- Bio-ORACLE
  - Collection of many different datasets
  - Most variables constrained to a 25km resolution
@Tyberghein2012  
@Assis2018b

# Modelling distribution {.tabset}

- A random forest model was used
- Which variables are important?
- What is the accuracy of the model?
- What is the range in accuracy?
- What is the distribution of inaccuracy?

## Variables

```{r, echo=FALSE}
load("data/top_full_kelpcover.RData")
knitr::kable(x = top_full_kelpcover, format = "html")
```


## Confidence {.tabset}

### Total cover
![](figure/conf_kelpcover.png)

### Laminariales
![](figure/conf_laminariales.png)

### Agarum
![](figure/conf_agarum.png)

### Alaria
![](figure/conf_alaria.png)


***

# Results {.tabset}

KFB: Show general kelp cover
KFB: Drop Alaria if necessary

- Note that the colour scales are not the same between figures

## Total cover
![](figure/prediction_kelpcover.png)

## Laminariales
![](figure/prediction_laminariales.png)

## Agarum
![](figure/prediction_agarum.png)

## Alaria
![](figure/prediction_alaria.png)

<!-- ## Coastal stretch -->
<!-- The thinking here was to show all of the coastal pixels as a histogram or something like that -->
<!-- Perhaps a histogram of depth <50 would be useful -->
